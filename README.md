# Binary-Tree-Visualizer
The program provides a simple, menu-driven interface to interact with the binary tree. The Insert Nodes option allows users to create the binary tree by entering values, which are added using level-order logic. The Properties Menu displays analytical information about the tree, helping users understand its structural characteristics. The Traversal Visuals option demonstrates how nodes are visited using different recursive traversal techniques. Finally, the Exit option safely terminates the program. This menu-based design makes the application easy to navigate and user-friendly for beginners.
